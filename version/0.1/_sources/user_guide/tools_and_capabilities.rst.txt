Tools and capabilities
======================

Tool availability model
-----------------------

PyMechanical-MCP uses connection-aware visibility.

- **Offline-capable tools** are available before any Mechanical session.
- **Live-session tools** use ``REQUIRES_MECHANICAL_TAG`` and remain hidden
  until you successfully call ``launch_mechanical`` or ``connect_to_mechanical``.
- If you use ``--connect-on-startup``, live-session tools are available
  immediately, and PyMechanical-MCP locks the connection lifecycle tools.

Always available (before connection)
------------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Tool
     - Description
   * - ``check_mechanical_installed``
     - Verify that Mechanical is installed and discoverable.
   * - ``check_mechanical_status``
     - Inspect current MCP connection state.
   * - ``list_mechanical_instances``
     - List running Mechanical processes.
   * - ``launch_mechanical``
     - Start a new Mechanical session. GUI is preferred by default, and batch mode remains available.
   * - ``connect_to_mechanical``
     - Attach to an existing Mechanical instance.
   * - ``get_guidelines_for``
     - Return workflow guidance by topic.

Available after connection
--------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Tool
     - Description
   * - ``disconnect_from_mechanical``
     - Gracefully detach from Mechanical.
   * - ``run_python_code``
     - Execute Python snippets in the persistent session.
   * - ``create_custom_plot``
     - Produce custom plots from analysis data.
   * - ``clear_mechanical``
     - Clear context and release session resources.
   * - ``run_python_script``
     - Execute a Mechanical script string or read one from a local file with ``file_path``.
   * - ``save_project``
     - Save active project.
   * - ``open_project``
     - Open an existing MECHDB project.
   * - ``upload_file``
     - Upload local file to Mechanical working directory.
   * - ``download_file``
     - Download file from Mechanical working directory.
   * - ``list_files``
     - List files in working directory.
   * - ``solve_analysis``
     - Solve active analysis system.
   * - ``get_model_info``
     - Return a structured model summary (geometry, mesh, analyses, results).
   * - ``screenshot``
     - Capture current Mechanical view.
   * - ``get_mechanical_logs``
     - Retrieve Mechanical logs for diagnostics.
   * - ``export_results``
     - Export result objects and artifacts.

.. note::
  When you run with ``--connect-on-startup``, PyMechanical-MCP disables
  the ``launch_mechanical``, ``connect_to_mechanical``, and
  ``disconnect_from_mechanical`` tools by design.

Guideline topics
----------------

``get_guidelines_for`` supports these topic values:

- ``workflow``
- ``geometry``
- ``materials``
- ``meshing``
- ``analysis_setup``
- ``boundary_conditions``
- ``solution``
- ``postprocessing``
- ``named_selections``
- ``general``

Tool set discovery resource
---------------------------

PyMechanical-MCP exposes ``toolsets://definition`` for service-side discovery.
The payload groups tools into:

- lifecycle
- scripting
- project-management
- file-management
- simulation
- inspection
- results
- guidelines

This resource is read-only metadata. It does not modify runtime behavior.

Example workflows
-----------------

Static structural run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. ``check_mechanical_status``
#. ``launch_mechanical`` or ``connect_to_mechanical``
#. ``upload_file`` (geometry)
#. ``run_python_script`` (import geometry, assign material, and mesh)
#. ``run_python_script`` (apply boundary conditions and loads)
#. ``solve_analysis``
#. ``export_results`` and ``screenshot``

Modal analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect to Mechanical.
#. Import the model and define fixed supports.
#. Create modal analysis settings with script tools.
#. Run ``solve_analysis``.
#. Use ``create_custom_plot`` for mode-shape reporting.

Checks after solving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. ``get_model_info`` for verifying solved state
#. ``get_mechanical_logs`` for warnings and errors
#. ``run_python_code`` for custom data extraction
#. ``export_results`` for report artifacts
