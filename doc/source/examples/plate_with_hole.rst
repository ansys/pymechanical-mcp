Plate with hole
===============

This example demonstrates a stress concentration analysis on a flat plate with a
central circular hole using PyMechanical-MCP. It is a classic benchmark for validating
stress concentration factors against the theoretical value of approximately 3x.

Engineering objective
---------------------

Compute the stress concentration factor for a 200 mm x 100 mm x 5 mm rectangular
plate with a 30 mm-diameter central hole under uniaxial tension. Compare the maximum
principal stress near the hole to the nominal far-field stress and confirm Kt ~= 3.

Geometry
--------

- **File**: `plate.step`
- **Dimensions**: 200 mm x 100 mm x 5 mm plate with 30 mm-diameter central hole

Setup requirements
------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Value
   * - Material
     - Structural Steel (default)
   * - Mesh
     - Element size 2 mm (fine mesh to resolve stress concentration)
   * - Fixed support
     - Left end face (YZ face at X = -100 mm)
   * - Tensile force
     - 10 000 N in +X direction on right end face (YZ face at X = +100 mm)

Tool workflow
-------------

1. Connect to or launch Mechanical using `connect_to_mechanical` or `launch_mechanical`.
2. Upload `plate.step` using `upload_file`.
3. Assign Structural Steel to the plate body using `run_python_script`.
4. Generate a 2 mm element size mesh for fine resolution near the hole using `run_python_script`.
5. Apply a fixed support on the left end face using `run_python_script`.
6. Apply a 10 000 N tensile force in +X on the right end face using `run_python_script`.
7. Run the solver using `solve_analysis`.
8. Add Total Deformation, Equivalent Stress, and Normal Stress X results using `run_python_script`.
9. Capture a screenshot of the equivalent stress contour using `screenshot`.

Expected outcome
----------------

- Stress concentration factor of approximately 3x at the hole edges (top and bottom).
- Classic butterfly stress pattern: high stress (red) at the hole edges tapering to nominal (blue/green).
- Maximum stress approximately three times the applied nominal stress.

Theory
------

For a plate with a central circular hole under uniaxial tension, Kt ~= 3.0 when the hole
diameter is small relative to the plate width. For this geometry (d/W = 30/100 = 0.3), Kt ~= 3.0.

Prompt example
