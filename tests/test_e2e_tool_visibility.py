"""End-to-end MCP protocol tests for tool visibility modes (dynamic vs. --static-tools).

These two tests use FastMCP's in-memory ``Client`` to exercise the real MCP
protocol surface (``tools/list``, ``tools/call``) against the actual
registered ``app``, as a regression safety net on top of the (faster) unit
tests in ``test_cli.py`` (launcher disable-logic), ``test_tools.py``
(per-tool ``enable_components``/``disable_components`` calls), and
``test_prompts.py`` (prompt selection) — all of which mock the relevant
calls rather than exercising FastMCP's actual visibility engine end-to-end.

Mechanical connections are mocked at the ``ansys.mechanical.core`` boundary
only; everything else (tool registration, visibility transforms, the MCP
protocol layer) is real.
